                <p>League of Legends is a free-to-play online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. It is a multiplayer online battle arena (also called as MOBA), two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play and role, as of 2024.10.20: 168 released champions. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within, also there is a mode called The Howling Abyss (a.k.a. ARAN) where the concept is the same, but its faster paced and more fun to play. There are some other highly liked modes: </p>

            <h3>Seasons and loots:</h3>
            <p>League's content is divided into seasons: Every 6 months there is a cylce called season, where you can rank up and earn valueable skins, chromas. Oh yes, forgot to mention that you can customize your champions' appearance by buying or opening skins from boxes and forging skins from orange essence. These skins are also ranked by rarity, in game value, and how good the skin looks. Fun fact, one of the rearest skin in league is called <a href ="https://www.gameleap.com/articles/top-10-rarest-league-of-legends-skins-ranked">Pax Twisted Fate</a>, which was a gift back in 2009 at Penny Arcade Expo. You could obtain this skin from a coupon. The unused cupon codes can be sold for $450-500. For example only approximately 20.000 players have this skin, while the total player count of league of legends is around 132 million. ONLY 0.0149% is the chance to play someone who has this skin!!!</p>
